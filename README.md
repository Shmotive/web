# Welcome to the web repository for Motive!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What's Motive?

Motive is an event planning app for any single user or group of users. We provide a space to vote on activities you might have in mind, in the form of a lobby. The app also provides the lobby with activity recommendations based on a chosen location, in case you don't have any activity ideas and would like somewhere to start!

# Motive Web Frontend

## Overview

Motive is an event planning tool that leverages real-time location-based recommendations and communcation in lobbies to enhance user experiences in discovering and scheduling activities. The application is designed to interact seamlessly with the Google Places API, providing tailored activity suggestions based on current location in an efficient manner.

## Architecture

This repository contains the frontend part of the Motive application, built with React. It interacts with a Express.js backend through GraphQL operations, ensuring a responsive, efficient, and dynamic user interface. The app is intended to work in conjunction with the Motive backend repository, which can also be found in the repository directory for this organization.
